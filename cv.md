## **About me:**
After graduating from university, I worked as an accountant in a bank for 4 years. In this direction, in such a short time, I achieved a certain growth and realized that I want to try myself in another area. At the moment, the IT sphere is a promising industry all over the world. Therefore, I would like to realize my potential in IT and contribute to the development of the Javascript community.
